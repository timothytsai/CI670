## Getting ready
This course uses the R statistical software package.  You should be able to
carry out all of the basic tasks for this course with R.  We also recommend
installing the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), an application
that provides many quality of life enhancements for programming in R.

Follow the steps below to install R and RStudio for Windows or Mac.

**Important** - you must have R installed before RStudio will work.

### Install R
