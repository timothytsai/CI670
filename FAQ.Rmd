## Why am I here?

You are here because you're a student in CI670 - Biostatistics with Computing.
You want to learn how to use R to perform exploratory data analysis and
statistical analysis on your data.

## How do I get help?

For course content, email me or your instructor.

But, the most important thing we can teach you is how to find your own answers.
Some resources: [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)
in RStudio, cheatsheets - go to Help and then cheatsheets.

## Why are you obsessed with R?

We try to be agnostic about our statistical software.  After all, it's a just a
means to an end.  BUT, R has some pros that we like.  This means that we get to
our destination with a little less pain and suffering, in style if you will.

R is growing in popularity

open data science

reproducibility

free

nice, relatively painless graphics

free

To be fair, other stats packages are more popular in certain industries.

## How did you make this awesome website?

This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which hosts
content directly from your [GitHub](https://www.github.com)  repository.

We wrote our content in R Markdown and pushed it to our personal repository.
From there, GitHub Pages grabs the html file and puts it out on the internet.
